**ENIDrift** is a fast and adaptive **E**nsemble system for **N**etwork **I**ntrusion **D**etection under real world **Drift**. The techniques design of this work in introduced in this paper. Generally, it consists of: 1) iP2V, an incremental packet-to-vector feature extraction method; 2) Sub-classifier generation module; 3) ENIDrift update module. Compared to other network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we place ENIDrift under real-world drift that involves dynamically distributed network packets and well-crafted ML attacks. ENIDrift is also much faster than state-of-the-art approach, which alleviates the preasure of processing speed of network packets in real world.
