# RWDIDS'22

RWDIDS'22 is the first dataset containing several real world drifts. It is a real-world drift dataset for network intrusion detection. It is made because no dataset is found focusing on the dynamic distribution in reality and including various real-world drifts. RWDIDS contains network packets of 6 days in level-2, where the distribution changes gradually and real-world drift grows heavy. And the data of 4 sub-experiments in level-3 mentioned above is also from RWDIDS. They are intense real-world drift caused by concept drift and well-crafted ML attack. And the ratio of the number of packages is imbalanced and changeable in RWDIDS, posing a threat to the training and updating of NIDSs. We capture network traffic by WireShark, extract network fields from original .pcap files to form .csv files, and open-source RWDIDS.

The network topology of our dataset RWDIDS and field test is shown in the above figure. It consists of 1) computers, which connect to the router; 2) a router, which is linked to the Internet and nine IoT and Bluetooth devices (e.g., Bluetooth audio, monitors) in our office; 3) a laptop, which makes attacks to the router. IoT devices are common in real networks and are used here to make a multiple-IP and dynamic network environment, and also are a breach for well-crafted ML attacks, like data contamination. All network packets via the router are captured and copied to ENIDrift, and ENIDrift needs to use the computing source of the computer.
